## 1. Introduction
**SignSprinters** is an organization formed to demonstrate how **Software Engineering principles** can be applied to impactful, real-world challenges.  

Our flagship project, the **Traffic Sign Recognition Demo (TSRS)**, combines **artificial intelligence**, **gamification**, and **Agile methodology** to deliver an interactive system that educates users on traffic signs while showcasing the value of structured software engineering practices.  

In our Agile team, the **Scrum Master also contributed as a developer**, balancing sprint facilitation with active coding and implementation tasks.  
Akshat focused on the **machine learning pipeline and testing**, ensuring accuracy and reliability across iterations.

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Reinforce **traffic sign awareness** in an engaging, interactive format.  
- Provide a **gamified training tool** for driving schools and learners.  
- Demonstrate the application of **Agile practices** in a collaborative environment.  
- Serve as a foundation for **AI-driven transport systems** and future research in autonomous driving.  

---

## 3. Scope
- **Users**: Play a racing game where traffic signs appear randomly on the track. Correct recognition ensures smooth progress, while mistakes trigger consequences such as speed reduction or penalties.  
- **System**: Integrates a stubbed machine learning model for recognition, displays confidence scores, and applies game mechanics in real time.  
- **Administrators**: Monitor player performance, review logs, and retrain the ML model with updated datasets.  

Practical applications include:
- Driver education in schools  
- Gamified road safety awareness programs  
- Research prototypes for AI in transportation systems  

---

## 4. Methodology
The project was developed using the **Agile Scrum framework**:
- **Sprint Planning**: Defined goals for each development cycle.  
- **Daily Standups**: Identified blockers and tracked progress.  
- **Sprint Reviews**: Presented working increments to mentors.  
- **Retrospectives**: Reflected on improvements for the next cycle.  

The Scrum Master acted as a **developer**, contributing directly to system implementation.  
Akshat was responsible for **machine learning model integration and testing**, ensuring the reliability of predictions and gameplay responses.  

Security was addressed using the **Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SecSDLC)**, with input validation, HTTPS enforcement, and safe data handling.
